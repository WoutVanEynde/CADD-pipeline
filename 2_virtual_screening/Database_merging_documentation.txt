#Specs = 205301 molecules
#Asinex = 323446 molecules
#Enamine = 2880827 molecules
#Ambinter = 9405640 molecules

1) Merging of different conformers of same database using mol key (NOT IMPORTING ID DUE TO BEING FAULTY)
2) Deleting duplicate mol entries
3) Duplicating mol field and converting of duplicate field to SMILES
4) Saving SMILES and PH4 fields as PH4_concat.txt
5) $ awk -F ',' '{print $1"," $5" "$4" "$3" "$2}' PH4_concat.txt > PH4_concatenated.txt
6) Open PH4_concatenated.txt so MOE makes it a .mdb (IMPORT SMILES AS 'char')
7) Merging PH4_concatenated.mdb and previously merged database using SMILES key
8) Sort database based on the seperate PH4's
9) Delete seperate PH4's and save as final version of that database
10) Wash molecules to neutralize; NEXT TIME DO DOMINANT 
11) Delete duplicate mols
12) Make new SMILES column and delete previous one
